        <h3>The United States of America</h3>
        <p>
                 
               &nbsp;&nbsp; USA Founded under the concept of a Republic (a government without a monarch, whoâ€™s elected 
                representatives are responsible to the governed) the founding fathers some 235 years ago set out declare its 
                independence and establish a new nation claiming their own sovereignty and rejecting any allegiances to the British Monarch.
                    This of course sparked the Revolutionary War in April of 1775 that lasted until September of 1783. 
                I am amazed that 38 men and later others could during a time of war come together and develop governing rules that
                would create the greatest (not perfect) nation in modern times. 
                The Senate on the other hand is straight forward with two Senators for each state, elected in a state wide election.
                        The House has the sole Power of Impeachment, and is the origination site for all bills to raise revenues.
                The Senate has sole power to try all impeachments. The other powers of Congress are outlined in section 8 of Article I of
                which taxes, coining money the power to raise Armies and maintain a Navy and the power to declare war are the most notable. 
                All votes by either House on any question shall be by Yeas and Nays and as such be entered into that Houses Journal.
