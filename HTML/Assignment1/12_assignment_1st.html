                Cloud computing refers to a model of computing where firms and individuals obtain computing power and software
                applications over the internet, rather than purchasing their own hardware and software (Laudon & Laudon 2010).

                The cloud computing service model involves the provision, by a service provider, of large pools of high
                performance computing resources and high-capacity storage devices that are shared among end users as required
                (Vaquero 2009). The service provider’s offering may also extend to the software applications required by the 
                end user. Cloud service model requires a high-speed network to provide connection between the end user and the
                service provider’s infrastructure.
                
                Cloud computing potentially offers an overall financial benefit, in that end users share a large, centrally
                managed pool of storage and computing resources, rather than owning and managing their own systems (Kondo 2009).
                The end user in turn sees convenience benefits from having data and services available from any location, 
                from having data backups centrally managed, from the availability of increased capacity when needed, 
                and from usage-based charging (Weiss 2007 & Hayes 2008).

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Datapipe, a provider of managed services and infrastructure for IT and cloud computing, 
                    is predicting that 2011 “will be the year when industry giants from across the spectrum-including major 
                    financial institutions, pharmaceuticals and retailers-will migrate major internal and external IT systems 
                    to the cloud.” (Sowinski 2010).
                        
                    Amazon was first to use a cloud-computing model for their business and now is the leader in providing 
                    cloud services to other businesses. Entrepreneurs are exploiting Amazon’s Web services, Microsoft’s 
                    Windows Azure hosting platform and other cloud services in order to start up companies because of the
                    zero capital equipment requirements. Payment is by credit card and you pay as you go (Bell 2011), 
                    examples like iTunes, Dropbox, Salesforce.com and HealthVault; which lets you store and share your
                    medical information.
                        
                    The idea of cloud computing is to make all the information and services run in data centers around the 
                    world available via the Web. These new approaches come along roughly every decade and promise to make 
                    computers cheaper and more accessible.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of organizations are already hosting and/or offering cloud computing services. 
                        Examples include Google Docs, Amazon’s Elastic Compute Cloud and Simple Storage services, 
                        Microsoft’s Windows Azure Platform, IBM’s Smart Business Services, Salesforce.com, and WebEx (Baliga 2011).

                        Amazon is on the Internet the biggest online retail merchant, everyday is bearing the massive network 
                        transaction, and simultaneously Amazon also provides the cloud computing service platform for the independent 
                        software development personnel as well as the developer. Amazon calculates theirs cloud the platform to be 
                        called elastic compute cloud (EC2), is most early provides the long distance cloud to calculate the platform 
                        service the company.
                        
                        Amazon own elastic computation cloud establishment in the platform which the company interior large-scale
                         colony calculates, but the user may operate through the elastic computation cloud network contact surface in 
                         the cloud calculates each instance.
                        
                        Amazon elastic compute cloud comes by the named Amazon Web services existing platform development. Amazon Web 
                        Services mainly is composed by 4 core services: Simple Storage Service; Elastic Compute Cloud; Simple Queuing 
                        Service as well as still occupied at present test stage SimpleDB (Zhang 2010).

                <li><h4>Benefits and Costs of Cloud Computing</h4></li>
                <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cloud services will ultimately save organizations money; cloud services are succeeding in delivering key 
                        benefits to the supply chain in the long run. In the cost modelling of cloud services, to offset the initial 
                        cost of acquisition of cloud services against existing system licensing and asset costs they will no longer 
                        have to pay (Shacklett 2010). Cloud services are less expensive solutions than internal systems, moreover the
                         best solutions for what a given business is striving to achieve in a given business scenario.

                        Cloud computing also allows users to automatically store and back up data without the risk of losing the 
                        information in a server crash. It provides organisations with sufficient control over cloud security and 
                        compliance to adapt to any type of workload, even mission-critical ones. And giving IT teams the ability to 
                        directly inspect and monitor conditions in private, public, or hybrid clouds so they can base their trust on 
                        first-hand observations, not just outside Attestations (Patterson 2011).
                        
                        Cloud allows organization to move away from managing their own data centers to focusing their attention and 
                        their resources-financial and human-on their core competencies. Cloud is enabling businesses to respond much 
                        more effectively to changes in demand. Cloud networks are evolving, linking organizations through complex, 
                        multiparty processes into single, virtual organizations (Giniat 2011).
                        
                        Cloud computing do not need high quality equipment for user, and it is easy to use. Cloud computing provides 
                        dependable and secure data storage center to avoid data loss or virus problems (Chen 2010). User saved the 
                        equipment and maintenance cost with the integrity virtual machine movement controls by user.
