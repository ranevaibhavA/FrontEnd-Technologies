        The dream destination of millions of people across the world, Machu Picchu is one of the seven wonders of the world. 
        It is located in the Cusco Region of Peruâ€™s Machupicchu District. According to the majority of archaeologists,
        the Inca emperor Pachacuti built Machu Picchu as an estate around the year 1450. The site developed as a city but was
        abandoned a century later during the Spanish Conquest. The site remained largely unknown to the rest of the world until 
        its discovery by the American explorer Hiram Bingham.
        Machu Picchu is a great representation of the Incan way of life.
