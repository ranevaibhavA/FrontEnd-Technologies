            <h4> <h3>History of TOR and why it was created</h3>  
                
                TOR is one of the most commonly used software to access the Dark Web. It is
                almost a fail-proof way of being anonymous. The history of Tor is quite
                interesting, and it can help people to understand why the need of Tor arose and
                why it is still relevant.
                It will come as a surprise that the roots of Tor can be traced back to the United
                States Naval Research Lab. Employees of the above organization viz.
                Syverson, Reed and Goldschlag researched ways to protect the intelligence
                communication in the mid-90s. This was the beginning of Onion routing. Onion
                routing then moved on to DARPA, and it was enhanced there in the late 90s.
                Syverson along with Mathewson and Dingledine launched the alpha version of
                Tor on 20th September 2002. It was then known as The Onion Routing project.
                A public version was released the next year.
                A turning point in the history of Tor was when Mathewson, Dingledine, and
                others created Tor Project in 2006. A non-profit organization runs and
                maintains Tor. It is a surprising fact that some of the early financiers of the
                project were Internews, Google, and University of Cambridge, US.
                International Broadcasting Bureau etc. It also received monetary support from
                Human Rights Watch. Nowadays, the US government supports the Tor Project
                financially.

        <h3>How Tor can help media and journalism </h3>
        In today’s world even the pillar if democracy that is media is not safe.
        Nowadays media is often biased, and paid media is a harsh reality. However,
        all of the media is not bias and many honest journalist exits unfortunately for
        them most of the media is now controlled and censored by the government of
        the world. This government does not let these honest journalists and media
        persons present their point of view in an unbiased and uncensored way. Tor
        can help such trapped media persons to present their honest views with full
        security, privacy, and anonymity.
        Using Tor, media persons can present the truth of their homeland with total
        security. With this the people who want unbiased news can get it from Tor as
        well. It should not come as a surprise that various American institutes support
        Tor to promote free speech and independence. Tor can also help you research
        controversial topics without any problems. These topics include sensitive
        subjects such as religion, terrorism, abortion, etc.

        <h3>Use of Tor by Law Enforcement</h3>




        The title of this section might surprise you thanks to various myths and legends
        prevalent about Tor and Dark web on the Surface web. One of the most
        common myths about Tor is that it is illegal and that it is only an interface to
        conduct illicit activities. However as said earlier this just a myth which is why
        law enforcements all over the world use Tor for a variety of purposes. The
        most common use is online surveillance
        Although it is quite possible to keep an eye on various illegal activities on the
        Surface web, it is a time and money-consuming affair. For instance, even if the
        cop is well versed in street slang and language their cover might blow away
        due to the simple fact their IP can be traced by these illegal sites. Hence cops
        often use Tor to conduct online surveillance. Tor can keep your IP, and all other
        details secure and hidden from everyone hence, making it one of the best
        options of surveillance to law forces.
        But do not worry, police forces only track people who are already under
        suspicion of illegal and illicit activities. So you can be sure that the forces
        won’t track you unless of course you visit and use these illegal sites

      <h3> How Whistle-blowers can use Tor </h3> 
        The world is becoming more and more violent day by day, which has led to the
        rise of human rights activists all over. However, due to censorship and archaic
        laws many human rights advocates cannot promote their cause freely. They
        cannot present their reports of abuses and dangers without threatening their
        lives. Tor can help these activists to present their point of view without any
        worry. Tor thus allows them to continue their work without the fear of
        persecution and in some cases execution.
        One of the major humanitarian organizations, the Human Rights Watch
        recommends Tor in its report Internet Censorship. This report has a section on
        how it is possible to break the Chinese firewall. Other prominent organizations
        such as Amnesty and Global Voices also recommend Tor.
        In many nations, whistle-blowers do not enjoy any legal protection provided
        by the government. However, whistle-blowers can continue with their work if
        they use Tor. They can continue their journey of seeking the truth without any
        problems.

        <h3>How can celebrities and underprivileged people use
                Tor?</h3>
                Everyone is obsessed with celebrities, and the fan girl culture has gained
                momentum over the last few years. We love our stars and want to follow them.
                However, all this limelight often disturbs their lives, which often causes them a
                lot of problems. The constant interference can be avoided if Tor is used.
                Celebs can keep blogs and present their political or other views online without
                ruining their image. Along with celebs, this can also help other high profile
                people who cannot enjoy a private online life.
                Underprivileged and people who live in poverty too cannot enjoy an entirely
                private life. They cannot participate in the society in totality. They constantly
                need to worry about their jobs, social workers, and others. A single bad
                comment can ruin their life. However, Tor can help such people to present their
                views without any fear. It gives voice to the voiceless. The poor, the dejected
                and the harassed can voice their opinion online without fearing any backlash.
