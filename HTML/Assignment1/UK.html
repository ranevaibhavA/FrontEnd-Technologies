    <h3>The united Kingdom(UK)</h3>

<p>
        The Unite Kingdom (UK) is a collection of multiple islands that is located off the northwestern coast of Europe between 
        the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea ("The UK," 2016).  Moreover, the UK has had a very robust history that began 
        over 35,000 years ago.  Currently, the UK allows its citizens to freely practice their religion of choice.  
        Therefore, there are multiple practicing religions throughout the collection of islands.  The below correspondence provides 
        a brief history of the UK, the current and projected population, different worldviews of the religions present in the UK,
        how Christian leaders and managers may be impacted by the diverse worldviews and how those leaders/managers should prepare to
        lead individuals throughout the country.  
        <h3>History of the United Kingdom</h3>
        The UK has gone through a plethora of rulers throughout its history.  
        It is said that around 35,000 years ago, that the first humans began to arrive in the region. 
        Monuments such as Stonehenge and Avebury were constructed during this time.  Many years later (1500 BCE and to 500 BCE)
        the Romans occupied these islands and during the time that they occupied the islands the Romans erected multiple cities.
