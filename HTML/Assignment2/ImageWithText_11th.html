                           <b>The Taj Mahal</b> is an enormous mausoleum complex commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the remains of 
                            his beloved wife. Constructed over a 20-year period on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, India, the famed 
                            complex is one of the most outstanding examples of Mughal architecture, which combined Indian, Persian and Islamic influences.
                            At its center is the Taj Mahal itself, built of shimmering white marble that seems to change color depending on the daylight. 
                            Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, it remains one of the world’s most celebrated structures and a stunning
                            symbol of India’s rich history.

                    Chandela Dynasty. As per historical records, the site hosted 85 temples by the 12th century of which only
                    about 20 survive to this date. The profusion of sculptures, intricate details, and symbolic designs all 
                    exhibit the great artistic wealth of ancient India. For all these reasons, it is regarded as one of the 7 
                    wonders of India.

                <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nalanda University In Bihar</b>A large Buddhist monastery and a world-renowned center of learning between the 7th century BCE and 1200 CE, 
                Nalanda well deserves to be one of the 7 wonders of India as well as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Nalanda is 
                located about 95 km from Patna, the capital city of India’s Bihar state. Nalanda is as one of the most famous 
                universities in ancient India that was inspired by the highly organized methods of Vedic learning. The university
                flourished during the reign of the Gupta Empire and later during the rule of the emperor of Kannauj, Harshavardhana.
                Nalanda during its peak time was attended by scholars who came from near and far including knowledge-seekers from 
                China, Korea, Central Asia, and Tibet. Sadly, it the University was ransacked and destroyed by a Muslim army of the
                Mamluk Dynasty in 1200 CE and was eventually abandoned and forgotten. Many years, later, 
                the Government of modern India revived the site, and today it attracts a large number of tourists to the Indian
                state.
