            The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) has incurred losses to the tune of Rs 50 crore over the past
             10 days. The losses are due to cancellations of bus services and damage to MSRTC properties, due to the floods across 
             parts of Maharashtra.

            According to officials, in the flood-affected districts of Kolhapur, Sangli, Pune and Satara, the MSRTC had to cancel more than 
            55,000 trips that led to a revenue loss of at least Rs 11 crore. “In Kolhapur alone, we were forced to cancel at least 29,50    
            
trips in the past 10 days. In Sangli, we cancelled 8,060 trips,” said an MSRTC official. Follow Weather forecast today LIVE

“The rains and resulting floods and waterlogging have affected MSRTC services across the state. Outside western Maharashtra,
 even in places where floods have not been reported, cancellations have happened. For example, in Marathwada division, thousands
  of trips have been cancelled due to rain-related issues,” said the official. According to officials, the total loss suffered by
   the MSRTC across the state was at least Rs 5 crore per day.

 lost. Similarly, Sangli division has cancelled 8,060 trips causing a revenue loss of Rs 4.25 crore. Satara has cancelled

        <h3>Remembering Vikram Sarabhai on his 100th birth anniversary: ‘He treated everyone as an equal’</h3>


        <p>
                Vikram Sarabhai never behaved like a boss and treated everyone as equals, so much so that even a peon could walk into his cabin with grievances,” recalls Prof Eknath Chitnis (94), who worked closely with Sarabhai from 1952 till he died in 1971.

                Sarabhai, Chitnis and many other scientists went on to lay the unshakable foundation of India’s space programme and eventually set up the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) that is now eyeing the Moon, Mars and even the Sun.
                
                It’s nearly 67 years ago, but Chitnis vividly remembers his first interaction with Sarabhai in October 1952, during the former’s interview for a post at the Textile Research Association in Ahmedabad. “I wanted to work as a researcher at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) and to do so, I needed the job. It was during the final round of interview, for which Sarabhai was also present, I asked him whether he was Vikram Sarabhai. To which, he responded, ‘I am Vikram’,” recalls Chitnis.
