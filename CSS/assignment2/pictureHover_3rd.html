                Sanjaya then told how the Lord Shri Krishna, seeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, his
                eyes dimmed with flowing tears and full of despondency, consoled him:
                “The Lord said: My beloved friend! Why yield, just on the eve of battle, to this weakness
                which does no credit to those who call themselves Aryans, and only brings them infamy
                and bars against them the gates of heaven?
                O Arjuna! Why give way to unmanliness? O thou who art the terror of thine enemies!
                Shake off such shameful effeminacy, make ready to act!
                Arjuna argued: My Lord! How can I, when the battle rages, send an arrow through
                Bheeshma and Drona, who should receive my reverence?
                Rather would I content myself with a beggar’s crust that kill these teachers of mine, these
                precious noble souls! To slay these masters who are my benefactors would be to stain the
                sweetness of life’s pleasures with their blood.
