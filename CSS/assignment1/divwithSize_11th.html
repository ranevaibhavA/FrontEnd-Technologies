                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A farmer had a dog who used to wait by the roadside for vehicles to come. As soon as one came,
                     he would run down the road, barking and trying to overtake the vehicle. One day the farmer’s
                      neighbour asked the farmer “Do you think the dog is ever going to overtake those vehicles?” 
                      The farmer replied, “That is not what bothers me. What bothers me is what he would do if he ever 
                      caught one.”

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people in life behave like that dog who is pursuing meaningless goals.
