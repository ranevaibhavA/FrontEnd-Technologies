            The Bhagavad-Gita is one of the most noblest and read scriptures of India, even 
            one of the deepest sacred scriptures of the world, really meant for all ages, even 
            more in this time and age, as it is a "psychology of the consciousness" in its 
            threefold phase. The dialogue of eighteen discourses {chapters), 700 verses 
            altogether, is a written contribution to the transformation of the embodied soul, 
            the whole man, or as the Bible puts it in "Genesis" the "man, the living soul". 
            The Bhagavad-Gita represents the soul-knowledge, the heart-love, the mind- 
            knowledge, the vital-dynamism and the body action.
