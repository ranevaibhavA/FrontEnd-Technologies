            “As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by 
            the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages.
             It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.
            
            He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. ‘Well,’ trainer
             said, ‘when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough
              to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can
               still hold them, so they never try to break free.’
            
            The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they
             couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.”
