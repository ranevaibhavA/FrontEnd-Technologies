                    “Once upon a time, a man found a butterfly that was starting to hatch from its cocoon. He sat down and watched the butterfly 
                 for hours as it struggled to force itself through a tiny hole. Then, it suddenly stopped making progress and looked like it was
                 stuck.

                Therefore, the man decided to help the butterfly out. He took a pair of scissors and cut off the remaining bit of the cocoon. 
                The butterfly then emerged easily, although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.

                The man thought nothing of it, and he sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly. However, that never 
                happened. The butterfly spent the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with small wings and a swollen body.

                Despite the man’s kind heart, he didn’t understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly to get 
                itself through the small hole were God’s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings to prepare itself for
                flying once it was free.”
