                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wise and successful man bought a beautiful house with a huge orchard. But, not all were happy for him.
                 An envious man lived in an old house next to him. He constantly tried to make his fellow neighbor’s stay in
                  the beautiful house as miserable as possible. He threw garbage under his gate and made other nasty things.
                
                One fine day the wise man woke up in a good mood and went into the porch to notice buckets of garbage thrown 
                there. The man took a bucket , cleaned his porch. He carried a bucket and went to knock his envious neighbor‘s
                 door. 
                
                The envious neighbor heard a knock at his door and gleefully thought, “ I finally got him!”. He answered his
                 door ready to quarrel with  his successful neighbor.  However the wise man gave him a bucket of freshly picked
                  apples saying, “The one who is rich in something, shares it with others.”
