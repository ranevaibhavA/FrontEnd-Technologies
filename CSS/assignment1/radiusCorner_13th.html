            Waiting for rabbit suicide
            Once here lived a lazy farmer who did not enjoy working hard in the fields. He spent is days napping under a tree.
             One day, while he was resting under a tree, a fox came chasing a rabbit. There was a loud THUMP–the rabbit had
              crashed into the tree and died.
            
            The farmer picked up the dead rabbit and took it home, frustrating the hell out of the fox. The farmer ate cooked
             and ate the rabbit for dinner and sold its fur at the market. The farmer thought to himself, “If I could get a rabbit 
             like that every day, I’d never have to work again.”
            
            The next day, the farmer went right back to the tree and waited for another rabbit to die in a similar way. He saw a 
            few rabbits, but none of them ran into the tree like before. Indeed, it was a very rare incident, but the farmer did 
            not realize it. “Oh well,” he thought cheerfully, “There’s always tomorrow.” Since, he was just waiting for the rabbit 
            to hit a tree and die, he did not give any attention to his field. Weeds grew in his rice field. Soon, the farmer had to 
            be hungry as he ran out of his rice and never caught any other rabbit too.
            
            Moral: Do not wait for good things to come without doing anything. Do not give your life to luck without working for 
            success.
